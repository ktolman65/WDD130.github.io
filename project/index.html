          We run rivers to relax
        </h2>
        <p>
          We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That 
          is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your 
          oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty 
          that surrounds the rivers we love.

          We run whitewaterfor the rush
        </h2>
         <p>
          That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after 
          all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down 
          the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful 
          water that always follows even more.
