          <h2 class="faq-title">FAQ</h2>
            <h3 class="faq-headline-1">Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
            <p class="faq-paragraph-1">
              Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over 
              the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children 
              are all over 8).  A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on 
              a boat for hours at a time.  Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas 
              we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might 
              see around any corner.  Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also 
              comes equipped with a guide.  It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at 
              all without telling stories...some of which are even true!
            </p>
          
            <h3 class="faq-headline-2">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
            <p class="faq-paragraph-2">
              As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your 
              safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of 
              rafting experience.  The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
              Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device 
              (PFD).  Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth 
              and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the 
              event that you fall out of the raft.

            <h3 class="faq-headline-3">What is included in the trip?</h3>

              changing or going to the bathroom.  Hat- large brim hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap.  
              Sunglasses with strap socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun.  sandals or water shoes- if

            <h3 class="faq-headline-5">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
            <p class="faq-paragraph-5">
              Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
              Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky.  Have a 
              hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the 
              day.  The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and 
              more good food.  We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or 
              good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like 
              steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies.  After 
              dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off 
              to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.
            </p>

            <h3 class="faq-headline-6">How far in advance should I book my trip?</h3>
            <p class="faq-paragraph-6">
              If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance.  If you can be more flexible 6 months 
              in advance is usually sufficient.
