      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever gone to a movie without checking its reviews or asking friends what they thought about it? Not many 
        people do. Well, the same could be said regarding hiking in Utah. With so many hiking trails Utah has to offer, where 
        does one start to explore? My website will provide that friendly review and detailed information that the average 
        visitor or even local resident will be happy to use when making their hiking choices. This website will provide 
        simple directions and details regarding the actual hike. Every hike on my site will be one I have taken personally. 
        The site will also include reviews from myself and others that have ventured these trails. With this information, anyone 
        can enjoy the magnificent beauty of the wonder we call Utah.
      </p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <h4>Heading Font: Open Sans, sans-serif</h4>
      <p>
        I found several websites that listed these two fonts as top choices because they work well together.  They 
        are both crispccand extremely legible.  They also work well if they are swapped around.

      <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto, sans-serif</h4>
      <p>
        Same comment as above.
