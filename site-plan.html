      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <h4>Heading Font: Open Sans, sans-serif</h4>
      <p>I found several websites that listed these two fonts as top choices because they work well together.  They are both crisp
         and extremely legible.  They also work well if they are swapped around.</p>
      <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto, sans-serif</h4>
      <p>Same comment as above.</p>
      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.
