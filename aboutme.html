    <p>
    I've lived in Utah most of my live.  I'm married to a wonderful woman named Jenn. We've been married for a year and a half and we were just sealed in the Draper UT temple 3 weeks ago.<br>
    Between us we have 7 kids, 5 sons/daughters-in-law and 10 grandchildren.<br>
    <br>
    I did not serve a mission.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm working on a Bachelors in Applied Technologies with my end goal to be a firmware engineer.
